## Support CocoaHub ❤️

Hello there 👋

I’m Pedro, a Portuguese iOS Engineer since February 2017. I’m an avid OSS enthusiast and contributor - help by sharing, learn by what’s shared.

I've built and open-sourced multiple frameworks and applications, including **[Brooklyn](https://github.com/pedrommcarrasco/Brooklyn)** and **[CocoaHub](https://cocoahub.app)**.

I'm also a conference and meetup organizer, being part of **[SwiftAveiro](https://swiftaveiro.xyz)** and **[CocoaHeads Porto](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Porto/)**.

If you enjoy my work and would like to help me continue it, please consider:
